    # Update/override PACKAGE_OPTS based on the ScanCentral Client documentation for your project's included tech stack(s). Helpful hints:
    #   ScanCentral Client will download dependencies for maven (-bt mvn) and gradle (-bt gradle).
    #   The current fortify-ci-tools image is Linux only at this time. Msbuild integration is not currently supported.
    #   ScanCentral has additional options that should be set for PHP and Python projects.
    #   For other build tools (-bt none), add your build commands to download necessary dependencies and prepare according to Fortify on Demand Packaging documentation.
    #   ScanCentral Client documentation is located at https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/fortify-software-security-center/ 
    PACKAGE_OPTS: "-bt none"
    
    # Update/override the FoDUploader environment variables as needed. For more information on FoDUploader commands, see https://github.com/fod-dev/fod-uploader-java. Helpful hints:
    #   Credentials (FOD_USERNAME, FOD_PAT, FOD_TENANT) are expected as GitLab CICD Variables in the template (masking recommended).
    #   Static scan settings should be configured in Fortify on Demand portal (Automated Audit preference strongly recommended).
    #   FOD_RELEASE_ID is expected as a GitLab CICD Variable.
    #   FOD_UPLOADER_OPTS can be adjusted to wait for scan completion/pull results (-I 1) and control whether to fail the job (-apf).
